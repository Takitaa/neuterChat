> I could write a book about this experience. The toughest 20 days - the exactly amount of time I'm in contact with Vue. Yep, apart from the name and interest to learn it, until then I haven't got the chance to experience it.
<br>


## After the dilemma Vue 3, Vue 1, finally Vue 2
Not without hard work and a lucky move: installing Vue little by little via npm and manually creating my project adding file by file, folder whenever needed etc. Goodbye Vue CLI! 
<br>

With this I could skip the issue with Vue Cli version versus useful Vue 2 (exclusively) modules/depedencies (vuetify, vue-video-player, vue-toggle-btn, etc).
<br>
<br>

## Speaking of depedencies...
There are too many of them, not all are used, I let them there for the souvenir of the struggle.

# To see by yourself start <ins>download code from [newMain branch](https://github.com/Takitaa/neuterChat/tree/newMain)  </ins>:

Then:

```
npm install
```

```
npm run serve
```

> The idea was to implement this Robohash random robots avatar for the chat avatar, it works with random letters. The logic was not implemented but the original version can be found in App-Robot.vue (when I want to test something like this, I change the name of App-Robot.vue to App, so the environment can read it and either name the previous App.vue to some identifiable backup or simply add a number to it, example: App2.vue).

>Still about the chat, there were some trying here and there. CSS is not my expertise (yet):

> Main difficulties:
- Lack of descriptive How Tos (half naked READMEs sucks!)
- The Vue.use {configurations} part is quite a mystery to me
- So many ways to write the same thing but which one is compatible to the version I'm using? as in, which one should I go to? It took me ages to understand where the import should go - because there were many JS places to put them üòÖ
- The combination of learning from zero - reporting - git repo and git hubing it as the three require discipline and a savoir faire that I don't yet master nor had I have previous examples.
- With the previous in mind, all the logic that seemed at first so clear v-for/item, transitions... got lost

<br>

> The Mock solution for the chat I wanted to go for was this one: https://learnvue.co/2020/09/a-quick-vue3-infinite-scrolling-component-daily-vue-tips-4/#mocking-an-api-call 

<br>

## In Sum:
- Practice does makes it better/easier.
- When given step-by-step how to, I learn faster, being able to deploy and adapt immediately.

## Ideas, ideas
> After all this fight with Vue, either the inspiratin site was updated or I could see it with different eyes (pool and other options). I would much like to implement a Modal as I normally don't appreciate leaving the chat ambient. I would use a transparent modal so the video could still be seen - to some degree, after all, when someone is going to pools and such, they are not really really interested in the video images but the chat/community experience.

> I liked the envelope thing proposed by BubbleChat, one thing that happens too often in a chat is the person missing a message to her. I would like to explore that.

> Implementing 1:1 areas, like a chat-room but just for the person who wants do "DM" you.

## Impossible is nothing?
- I "broke" my git/GitHub in the making and became extremely suspicious and distrustful of it for this freestyling process, so after apparently loosing it all - adding a repository to another repository after VS Code would just stop recognizing git commands plus a 10k stage/commit he tried to force me into plus not being able to switch into branches, I started to update/upload files via browser.
